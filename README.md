# CMPG 323 Project 5 - Reporting & Monitoring

## Background <br />
A Power Bi report is a multi-perspective view into a data model, with visualizations that represent different findings and insights from that data model. A report can have a singe visualization or pages full of visualizations. These visualisations represent data through visuals. They can be used tounderstand the context of data points, map data points together in logical groups, compare data points to one another, enable better decision making. <br /><br />

## How to use the Report (for users)
The report consists of a High-Level Metrics page, a Device Monitoring page, and a Device Registration page. <br />
All pages have a synced filter tab which can be used to filter the report based on on device category, device zone, device platform, and device registration date.<br />
The High Level Metrics page has a summary view that shows business stakeholders a high-level view of the important data such as the amount of devices that are online and offline, earliers and latest dates that devices were installed, standard deviation of the year selected by filter, count of device names, and the year that has the highest number of devices created. <br /> <br />
The Device Monitoring page has a 3 different visuals. One that allows the user to monitor devices per category, one that allows the user to monitor devices per zone, and one that allows the user to monitor online versus offline devices (status should depict whether a device is online or offline). <br /> <br />
The Device Registration page has the a visual that allows the user to see how many devices have been registered over a timespan, a visual that allows the user 
to see how many categories of devices have been created, and a visual that allows the user to see how many zones contain registered devices on a timeline.<br />
